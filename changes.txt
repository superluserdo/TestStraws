Changes to Barry's Teststraws.C code:

- Can now take command line options like verbosity, filenames, file creation, etc, and parse them.

- ./Teststraws is now compiled with the command "make" (runs on "makefile" in the same folder).

- Prints set of instructions when "--help" or "-h" is typed.

- variable = variable + 1; is now variable++;

- variable = variable * 100.0; is now variable *= 100.0; etc.

- Added error checking when loading user-specified data file

- Moved some stuff into a TestStraws.h header file

- Deleted Trkinf/2/3 from new version as they don't appear to do anything

- xy2u, xy2v, u2xy, v2xy are now one function, coordConvert, that takes a u/v (0/1) argument and a "to xy"/"to u/v" (0/1) argument.

- Strte2 and Strte3 are now one function, straw_FindEvent, that specifies the side that has a hit on both layers.

- Removed iStraws as argument to straw_FindEvent, since it seeemed unnecessary.

- for (int index=1; index<=max; index++) is now for (int index = 1; index < max; index++). 
  This means much more uses of array[index] instead of array[index-1].
  Also, this means that eg., Nmod=2 means we are looking at the 3rd module (the number 3 would still be written to file/stdout though).

- Fixed "potential memory leak" warnings by giving the TH1Fs unique names
