Changes to Barry's Teststraws.C code:

- Can now take command line options like verbosity, filenames, file creation, etc, and parse them.

- Prints set of instructions when "--help" or "-h" is typed.

- variable = variable + 1; is now variable++;

- Added error checking when loading user-specified file
